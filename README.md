Some questions for reasoning:

1. How would you automate this process so that we can get new datasets every day?
2. What file format would you use to store this data?
3. How would you evaluate the quality of the collected data?

Answers
1. Making apis that allow us to use it easily, post the link to api and get the structured data
2. I use csv format. Because this format is convenient for most languages
3. It depends on how long you work on it and with passion. I think if data is detailed to small parts. With details we can make many features like filtering and getting exact data
